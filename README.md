# CFG Challenge: use a brute force method to decrypt a password

Here we used 4 brute force methods to decrypt a password.

+ Random Choice (suggested by another CFG Python class attendee)


+ Potential Characters as Bases


+ Nested For Loops


+ Itertools.product (suggested on StackOverflow and adapted for this problem)

---

What we learned:
+ Solutions to the same problem can be vastly more/less efficient (which would be  important in a business setting).
+ Python has many modules (such as itertools), which other users have created to solve common problems.
+ Pair programming can be very useful to figure out knotty problems!
